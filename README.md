# TinKer - "Tiny Kernel"
A simple kernel currently targeting the x86 architecture

## Building the kernel
You will need a [cross-compiler](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) to build this kernel, as an OS-specific toolchain is not available yet.  
To build the kernel, create a 'build' directory, then run  
`cmake ../` and `make`
